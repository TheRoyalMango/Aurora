 kuzbass_autonomous_industrial_colony_desc:0 "The Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony is an experimental community established in the Kuznetsk Basin (Kuzbass) region of the Altai Federation in 1921. It aims to create a self-sufficient and egalitarian community where workers collectively own and manage the means of production. The colony focuses on industrial development, particularly in mining and metallurgy, and emphasizes worker participation, cooperation, and shared ownership. Many people come from around the world to participate in this great worker's control experiment. Over the years most of the Kuzbass AIC's teething problems have been fixed, but there is still minor hiccups in specialization and costs of maintaining the experiment."

 anarchist_elected_officers_desc:0 ""Officers" in the traditional sense have been abolished, instead, all commanders are elected and recallable. Regular mass assemblies are held to discuss policy. This lack of central authority means battleplans take forever to be approved, but the final result is more rewarding as they have been reviewed many times by all. The army is based on self-discipline, and all of the army's disciplinary rules are approved by soldier assemblies. This means soldiers are safeguarded from harsh leaders and highly motivated, but the organization of the army overall is lacking."
