 FIN_finnish_estonian_pact:0 "Finnish–Estonian Defence Cooperation"
 FIN_finnish_estonian_pact_desc:0 "Finnish–Estonian defence cooperation began in 1930 with a secret military pact between Finland and Estonia against the threat of the Soviet Union. Plans for blocking the Gulf of Finland, the use of coastal artillery, coordination in submarine purchases, and radio intelligence have thusfar been the main focus of the pact."
 EST_lack_of_funds_for_the_military:0 "Poorly-Funded Armed Forces"
 EST_lack_of_funds_for_the_military_desc:0 "Estonia's armed forces, despite being determined and rather experienced, are very poorly funded. This is not due to politics, but rather simply because Estonia does not have enough wealth to support a modern military. Almost all of our weapons are foreign made, and even our uniforms are made in America."
