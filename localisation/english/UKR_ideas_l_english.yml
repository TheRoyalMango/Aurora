  UKR_outdated_economic_system:0 "Struggling Agrarian Economy"
  UKR_outdated_economic_system_desc:0 "Ukraine's main exports are grain, wood and natural resources. We supply Europe with food and raw materials, and in exchange import machinery and consumer items. This exchange, however, is not in our favour, and in order to cover the demand for goods at home, we sell much greater quantities of natural resources than are required to produce the same quantity of goods locally. We face a difficult choice - whether to attempt to modernize the country and industrialize at the expense of the grain production or embrace our status as the \"breadbasket of Europe\" and abandon the hopes of significantly expanding our industry. One thing is clear, however - until we make that choice, there is no way out of the crisis."
  UKR_chaotic_politics:0 "Chaotic Political Scene"
  UKR_chaotic_politics_desc:0 "The Ukrainian politics are chaotic and violent, fueled by the lack of decisive action by the government. Despite the uncertainty in Russia, Anarchist banditry and shattering Polish-Ukrainian alliance, the government does almost nothing to improve the defensive capabilities of Ukraine, nor to improve its economic situation since the failure of land reform and the start of the Great Depression."
  UKR_chaotic_politics_tt:0 "If §Ystability§! drops below §Y30%§!, the §Ynon-parliamentary groups§! might attempt to §Roverthrow the government§!!"
  UKR_ministry_for_occupied_western_territories:0 "Ministry for Occupied Western Territories"
  UKR_ministry_for_occupied_western_territories_desc:0 "The Ministry for Occupied Western Territories is a government body that is responsible for the restoration of Ukrainian sovereignity over Budzhak, Bucovina and Galichyna and the protection of lives and well-being of the ethnical Ukrainians until that process is finished. Although its existence is supported by the nationalists, the government of Ukraine is divided whether to reform it into something more peaceful to maintain the alliance with Poland and Romania or to break the deal with the devil and use the ministry as the starting point for establishing Greater Ukraine."
  UKR_ministry_for_occupied_western_territories_tt:0 "The §Yfuture of this ministry§! and the §Yprospects of reclamation of our Western lands§! will be §Ydetermined§! by the outcome of the §YIntermarium Conference§! in §YJune 1936§!."
  UKR_UVO_influence_1:0 "UVO Conspiracy"
  UKR_UVO_influence_1_desc:0 "The Ukrainian Military Organisation (UVO) is a nationalist organisation, formed by the remnants of the military of the exiled West Ukrainian People's Republic. UVO fought a bloody guerilla war against the Polish Republic in the early 1920s, but as the situation stabilized and the relations between Ukraine and Poland improved, they had to relocate to Ukraine, where the UVO escaped persecution and entrenched itself in the military. UVO is very militaristic and nationalist in its ideology and many consider it, for the lack of a better description, a fascist conspiracy that inflitrates the government, pushes it to militarize and fight against Ukraine's neighbours; even worse, some suspect that their leaders are plotting their own coup attempt against the Republic."
  UKR_agrarian_society:0 "Agrarian Society"
  UKR_agrarian_society_desc:0 "Forcing the industrialization of the country that is traditionally agrarian is the mistake we can least afford to make. The Ukrainian spirit and economy lie in the countryside, close to the nature and away from the noisy cities and we cannot image a future, where things will be different."
  UKR_industrializing_society:0 "Industrializing Economy"
  UKR_industrializing_society_desc:0 "We have a goal to build a modern Ukrainian economy, and even though we are far from it, it is time we take the first shy steps in that direction."
  UKR_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
  UKR_economic_reforms_desc:0 "The government of Ukraine has finally decided to take decisive steps to deal with the economic and political effects of the crisis. Time will tell how successful these policies will prove to be, but for now, it appears, things look better for [UKR.GetName] once again."
  UKR_trade_deal_POL_ROM:0 "Intermarium Trade Treaties"
  UKR_trade_deal_POL_ROM_desc:0 "The nations of the Intermarium have signed a series of trade agreements that allow us to trade on better terms and improve the economic situation in our countries."
