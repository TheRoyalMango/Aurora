 afs.1.t:0 "Vorozhtsov Under Suspicion"
 afs.1.d:0 "A correspondence between the commander of the Barnaul militia, Matvey "Anatoly" Vorozhtsov, and the Bolshevik party in the West has been uncovered recently. Dated to 1923, Vorozhtsov discusses plans to secure control over the Altai Insurgent Army - by means of a coup d'État - and instituting a military dictatorship over the province of Altai, placing it under the tutelage of the Bolshevik government in Vologda. Vorozhtsov's advocacy for close cooperation with the Bolsheviks has so far been tolerated, however since this discovery has been passed on to the press, debate has flared up over what his true intentions may be. Chairman of the Communal Council, Ivan Novoselov, has personally denounced Vorozhtsov as a traitor to the revolution and called for his expulsion from the Insurgent Army. However, Vorozhtsov is very popular among his militia, not to mention the citizens of Barnaul, having led many successful attacks against the reactionary Whites back during his time as a partisan in the Civil War. Vorozhtsov himself asserts that he has come to appreciate the Anarchist way of life since those days, and merely seeks a strong ally in the Bolsheviks against the greater threat of the White Movement and, further afield, Fascism. Commanders of the Insurgent Army have convened to discuss the situation and decide on a course of action."

 afs.1.b:0 "Vorozhtsov's case must be brought before a Tribunal."
 
 afs.2.t:0 "Trial Inconclusive"
 afs.2.d:0 "After much debate and investigation of Vorozhtsov's ties with the Bolsheviks, no further communication between the two has been verified. Those still sceptical of his allegiance maintain that he is not to be trusted in a position of such influence, and propose that he be transferred, along with other Bolshevik sympathisers, to a new "Military Technical Council", acting as advisors to the Insurgent Army. Critics of this proposal accuse its proponents of a sort of political purge, and argue that Anarchist society can only advance through accepting and encouraging dissenting views. The Tribunal must settle on a solution."
 afs.2.a:0 "He is too dangerous in his current position, find a use for his talent elsewhere."
 afs.2.b:0 "As long as we keep a close eye on him, then Anatoly is safe, for now..."
 
 afs.3.t:0 "Anatoly Contests Dismissal!"
 afs.3.d:0 "Our dismissal of Vorozhtsov without a trial has been rejected by the soldiers of the Barnaul militia. An impromptu meeting of a large number insurgents has declared its support for their Commander and refused to elect a replacement. Vorozhtsov was invited to this meeting, and obliged to give a speech, in which he identified the main threat to Soviet Democracy as the Anarchists' rejection of hierarchical leadership - without which the Altai was slowly falling into disorganisation and dictatorship. The Barnaul militia have enthusiastically heeded his warning and resolved to take the town, establishing their own Revolutionary Committee."
 afs.3.a:0 "The Traitor has shown his true colours!"
 
 afs.4.t:0 "Fallout of the Vorozhtsov Trial"
 afs.4.d:0 "While most have come to agree with the action the Insurgent Army has taken in regards to Commander Vorozhtsov, the whole affair has brought to light flaws in the structure of the military. The popular newspaper 'Siberian Anarchist' has pointed out the hasty response by the General Staff really ought to have been up to the public, and questioned the lack of protocol in place to allow for this. Many are starting to see dictatorial elements in the structure of the Insurgent Army, and various local publications, advocacy groups, and the political opposition are all calling for total reform. Delegations from all across the Altai have travelled to Novosibirsk to discuss the future of the Insurgent Army."
