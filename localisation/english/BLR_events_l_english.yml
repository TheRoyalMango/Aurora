 blr.22.d:0 "[BLR.GetNameDefCap] has formally requested that Boris Savinkov be allowed to travel to Belarus to join the fight against the Soviet-backed government. According to their request, they wish for Savinkov to re-create the 3rd Russian Army in Belarus. In exchange, they pledge to support us in our fight against Moscow after their victory. \n\n Savinkov, for his part, is quite enthusiastic about the idea. He created the Russian Political Comittee in Poland and the 3rd Russian Army during the civil war, which was composed of Ukrainians, Belarussians, Russians, Poles, and Green Partisans. They fought alongside the Belarussians in the later stages of the civil war and were evacuated to Poland following their defeat, where they were dissolved. \n\n Re-creating the 3rd Russian Army will significantly assist the anti-communist Belarussians. In the case of an anti-communist victory, the troops may return home or we may choose to keep them there to guard Belarus. If the civil war is lost, the soldiers will trickle back to Crimea."

 blr.25.d:0 "[BLR.GetNameDefCap] has requested that [EST.GetNameDefCap] assist their anti-communist cause by using our nation as a go-between for buying foreign airplanes. We'll buy the planes, likely form England, and then re-sell them to [BLR.GetNameDefCap] at a higher price. \n Just like when we sold captured WW1-era destroyers to Peru in the 1930s, this sale will provide funds we can use to improve our military.
