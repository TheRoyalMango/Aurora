 RUS_gathering_storm_desc:0 "After the failure of the Kuban Landings and the loss of North Taurida, the Army of Wrangel found itself besieged on the Crimea with no means of sustaining itself in either food or munitions. Only a reluctant Britain and France kept the penisula afloat and fed. The success of the Polish-Ukrainian in Ukraine saved the Army of Wrangel from annhilation, but by then it was painfully clear neither the Entente not Poland and Ukraine wished to continue fighting. Britian threatened to cut off all aid unless Wrangel entered peace talks with Moscow or carried out Wrangel's planned evacuation. France however, suggested an alternative option: turn the Crimea into a League of Nations mandate. Officially, Crimea would revert back to the Crimean Tartar government, but this was only a facade to please Moscow. The Army of Wrangel was preserved by designating it the Crimean Mandate Defense Forces, and Crimea become a bastion for White Russians everywhere fleeing the Bolsheviks. Today the Crimean Mandate is carefully watched by Britian and France to enforece its neutrality, but it is no secret the White Movement is alive and well under the surface. It would only take a spark to reignite the flame."

Only a reluctant Britain and France kept the penisula afloat and fed. The success of the Polish-Ukrainian in Ukraine saved the Army of Wrangel from annhilation, but by then it was painfully clear neither the Entente not Poland and Ukraine wished to continue fighting. Britian threatened to cut off all aid unless Wrangel entered peace talks with Moscow or carried out Wrangel's planned evacuation. France however, suggested an alternative option: turn the Crimea into a League of Nations mandate. Officially, Crimea would revert back to the Crimean Tartar government of years prior, but this was only a facade to please Moscow. The Army of Wrangel was preserved by designating it the Crimean Mandate Defense Forces, and Crimea become a bastion for White Russians everywhere fleeing the Bolsheviks.

The Cossacks are masters of horse but even the regular cavalry are excellent. The enlisted men are very experienced and determined, and actually contain many former officers in their ranks, making perfect NCOs. Combined with a surplus of imperial generals who joined the White Army en masse, the army is well led, well organized, and has plenty of room for expansion. \n \n Only by rectifying the problems in our military, building upon our strengths, and adapting to modern times will the Russian Army be able to liberate Russia and defend it from foreign threats.\n §!"
