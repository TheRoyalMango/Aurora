  ukr_they_decline_tt:0 "For every §Ycountry§! that §Rdeclines§! our offer, the §Yfollowing effects§! are §Yapplied§!:"
  ukr.1.t:0 "The [UKR.GetAdjective] government asks us for a loan."
  ukr.1.d:0 "The [UKR.GetAdjective] government has asked us for help to industrialize and militarize the country. They want us to give them a low-interest loan so that they could use the money to bailout some of the largest textile factories and small arms companies. Investing in those companies does not give us a direct benefit, but it would allow [UKR.GetName] to get out of the crisis more easily, bolster her and Crimean defences, and, more importantly, keep their government from further destabilization."
  ukr.1.a:0 "Give them what they want, hopefully this will prevent a regional crisis."
  ukr.1.b:0 "We don't have the funds to spare right now."
  ukr.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] sends us money!"
  ukr.2.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to provide us with the much-needed financial assistance on the condition that we will not take any \"destabilizing actions\" in Eastern Europe. Even though they gave their approval to our rearmament, they will likely withdraw their assistance should we go beyond the \"necessary defensive measures\"."
  ukr.2.a:0 "How generous of them."
  ukr.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] refuses to aid us!"
  ukr.3.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with what can be counted as bad news - the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has given us no financial aid, which undermines the fragile trust that the people gave to us. However, by refusing to commit to improve the security of Western Europe, they have effectively untied our hands and the hands of our enemies to fight for the ethnical territories we thought we could never regain. Whether the Republic survives or not, there is nothing stopping Ukraine from pursuing its glory."
  ukr.3.a:0 "And they want us to do their dirty work in Crimea?"
  ukr.4.t:0 "[UKR.GetName] offers a trade deal."
  ukr.4.d:0 "As the ties between us and [UKR.GetName] have strengthened over the last few decades, it also has positively affected the trade between two nations. As such, the [UKR.GetAdjective] delegation has arrived to discuss a free trade deal, under which the exports and imports between us and our allies would not have any tariffs. Should we sign this deal, we would find it much easier to buy Ukrainian resources, but do we want to risk integrating our economy with theirs?"
  ukr.4.a:0 "It is a deal that truly benefits us both."
  ukr.4.b:0 "Our own stability cannot not be dependent on [UKR.GetAdjective] economy."
  ukr.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] accepts our offer."
  ukr.5.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has agreed to sign our trade deal. We and them now benefit from the easy access to each other's resources and products. Hopefully, our shared efforts will allow us to recover from the crisis and develop a functional economy faster than if were we to do it on our own."
  ukr.5.a:0 "A sign of healthy relations between our nations."
  ukr.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] refuses to sign the free trade agreement."
  ukr.6.d:0 "After reviewing the terms of the treaty, and a lengthy debate between the highest officials in the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, [FROM.GetLeader] has personally delivered a statement that argued that the terms of the treaty were unacceptable, as they allow us to benefit way more than they would could ever do due to the wording of the treaty. Clearly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] nationalists in the government have no intention to continue the economic cooperation between our nations."
  ukr.6.a:0 "We won't make this offer twice."
  ukr.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] investment into our industry."
  ukr.7.d:0 "Our cooperation with [FROM.GetName] has finally brought some fruits. The [FROM.GetAdjective]s have invested in our developing textile and arms industry in exchange for a discount on machinery shipments that we provide with our heavy industry. This short-term deal will allow both nations to expand their industrial output."
  ukr.7.a:0 "An excellent initiative from our [FROM.GetAdjective] partners!"
