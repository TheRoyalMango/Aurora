 NFE_peasant_republic_faction_member_desc:0 "The alliance of peasant republics was created quickly after the collapse of central power in Siberia in response to Mongolia's attempts to expand into Siberia. Aided by the threat of Chinese troops on Mongolia's southern border, the republics have thus far resisted Mongolia's aggressions and continue to do so. However, Japan's aggression into China means Mongolia may finally be free to pursue expansion without the threat to their south punishing them if they overreach. "

They'll make it very difficult for foreign armies to occupy the country, but also make it very hard for our government to control the countryside. \n Currently the Green Army is content with our government and engages in cooperation with us."

 KIR_kirensk_desc:0 "After the Soviets and Japanese came together for talks about Siberia, the area surrounding Kirensk was supposed to be incorporated into the Soviet puppet Autonomous Siberian Republic. However, the heavy regulations posed on the buffer state meant Tomsk had no real way of extending authority over Kirensk. The remote location did make for a great place for the Soviets to deport their religious opposition to though. After some time of rule by confederated villages, exiled Orthodox priests united Kirensk into a Patriachate ruled by the faith."

 ALT_religious_conflict_desc:0 "Burkhanism or Ak Jang is the new religion of the Altaians who seek to distance Altai from its Russian past and fear displacement from Russian colonists. This movement and the opposition to Russification created a common sense of nationality and desire for self determination, which was fulfilled in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. However, Russians living in the region are now afraid of the new religion competing with their Orthodox Christian faith and frequenlty come into conflict with the population."
 ALT_karakorum:0 "An Independent Altai"
 ALT_karakorum_desc:0 "The Karakorum Government was created in the chaos of the Russian Civil War by Altai nationalists who sought self-determination for their people and protection for their faith. This was intended to include not only Altai but also neighboring republics of Tuva, Minusink, Khovd, Dzungaria, and Khakassia, and declared as the first step to rebuilding Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire. Altai's small population meant it was too weak to fufill this goal, and instead relies on Mongolia for protection and support for an eventual unification of the Mongolian Empire."
