  UKR_handle_the_economic_freefall:0 "Handle the Recession"
  UKR_handle_the_economic_freefall_desc:0 "Ukraine was not spared from the horrors of the Great Depression. Banks were closed, factories turned unprofitable and were shut down - and the unemployment rate exploded. The government has only one way to escape the recession - to intervene in the economic affairs and choose to either support the developing industry or utilize our enourmous agrarian production."
  UKR_prioritize_the_agriculture:0 "Double Down on the Agriculture"
  UKR_prioritize_the_agriculture_desc:0 "If there is one thing we have no shortage of, it is the arable land that covers more than half of our territory. Our potential to grow crops is almost limitless. If we have so much trouble industrialising, we can use our sustainable development options, using the growing agriculture to propel ourselves out of the crisis."
  UKR_investments_into_grain_production:0 "Grow Wheat and Rye"
  UKR_investments_into_grain_production_desc:0 "Wheat is one of the main crops grown in the country, and there seems to be no shortage for demand. Our efforts to expand the wheat-growing farms poses almost no risk, but the gains can be enourmous, so let us plant the seeds of success now."
  UKR_investments_into_sugar_production:0 "Grow Sugar Beet"
  UKR_investments_into_sugar_production_desc:0 "Sugar is a basic commodity that has no bounds for demand growth. Though growing sugar cane in our moderate climate is quite unrealistic, sugar beet is a viable alternative that demands more moderate climate and is not that hard for us to grow."
  UKR_mechanisation_and_fertilisers:0 "Modern Farming Methods"
  UKR_mechanisation_and_fertilisers_desc:0 "Although agriculture is the backbone of our economy, it remains hopelessly technologically backward and inefficient. Carried by the sheer size of farms, our unproductive agriculture wastes so much potential that it is treason not to introduce new farming methods such as using machines and chemical fertilisers to squeeze everything we can out of every hectare of arable land."
  UKR_agrarian_economy:0 "Export-Based Agrarian Economy"
  UKR_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "We finally made the commitment to switch our focus from industrialization to a more natural path of growing our agrarian potential. It is time that we introduce new crops, expand existing farms and subsidize the creation of new ones."
  UKR_breadbasket_of_europe:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
  UKR_breadbasket_of_europe_desc:0 "The destruction of the Great War, the Revolution and the war against Russian aggression is finally over and we are once again the dominant producer of most essential crops. Not only do we produce more than enough food to cover our own demands, we can now safely feed triple our population - let us put this resource to a good use then."
  UKR_kharkiv_tractor_factory:0 "Kharkiv Tractor Factory"
  UKR_kharkiv_tractor_factory_desc:0 "We must build the planned Kharkiv Tractor Factory - a facility that would, in theory, cover the demands of the entire Ukrainian agrarian sector. With the state backing the ambitious project, the success is almost guaranteed."
  UKR_donbas_fertiliser_plants:0 "Donbas Fertiliser Production"
  UKR_donbas_fertiliser_plants_desc:0 "With us regaining the Donbas region, we can use the existing chemical industry to produce fertilisers from synthetic ammonia in an effort to reduce imports of fertilisers for our domestic crop production."
  UKR_prioritize_the_industry:0 "Don't Put the Eggs In One Basket"
  UKR_prioritize_the_industry_desc:0 "In the modern era, agriculture alone can never generate enough revenue to cover the cost of imports of manufactured goods. We should try to modernize and diversify our economic output, so bad weather cannot disrupt it and so that we are less reliant on our imports. Should the industrialization go well, we may start producing commodities for exports, not just for covering our own domestic needs."
  UKR_textile_industry:0 "Textile Industry"
  UKR_textile_industry_desc:0 "One of the main weaknesses of the Ukrainian economy is our reliance on imported basic consumer goods, such as clothing. We should build new factories to process large amounts of cotton, so that we can turn our greatest import into one of main our exports."
  UKR_urbanization_policies:0 "Urbanization"
  UKR_urbanization_policies_desc:0 "As people leave the villages in search for opportunities, we must ensure that the city infrastructure can accomodate new settlers, so that as we create more jobs in the urban areas, the flow of people does not disrupt the life of the inhabitants."
  UKR_zaporizh_steel:0 "Invest in Metallurgy"
  UKR_zaporizh_steel_desc:0 "We lack heavier industry to support the extraction of natural resources. Ukraine is rich in coal and steel, yet almost none is processed in here - instead we ship raw iron ore into Europe. Obviously, this economic model has its flaws, and we should try to build our own iron processing plants close to where the ore is extracted."
  UKR_found_the_car_industry:0 "Ukrainian Car Industry"
  UKR_found_the_car_industry_desc:0 "The times when trains and horses were the main mode of transport is over. Cars and buses are slowly but surely starting to replace the normal modes of transports in the cities, and we are not going to fall behind in car development."
  UKR_industry_in_donetsk:0 "Industrialization of Donbas"
  UKR_industry_in_donetsk_desc:0 "Once we have regained the densely populated regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, we can rebuild the broken and abandoned production facilities as well as open new ones - after all, they have no shortage of people who need jobs."
  UKR_dnipro_hydro_electric_power_station:0 "Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant"
  UKR_dnipro_hydro_electric_power_station_desc:0 "The river of Dnipro is an artery of freshwater flowing through Ukraine. Its current can be utilized to produce electricity and if there is one thing industrializing Ukraine does not have an excess of, then it is energy to make the factories we built work."
  UKR_dnipro_steel_production:0 "Dnipro Steel Industry"
  UKR_dnipro_steel_production_desc:0 "Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih are the base for many former Russian metallurgical companies, which can be expanded to meet the demand for metal. We shall found the Kryvorizhstal and invest into Dnipro Metallurgical Combine and Dnipro Metallurgical Factory to boost regional steel production and create more jobs."
