 caucasus_alliance:0 "Free Peoples of the Caucasus"
 DAG_defense_of_the_nation:0 "Defense Council of the North Caucasus and Dagestan"
 DAG_defense_of_the_nation_desc:0 "During our fight for independance from various foreign powers, the Defense Council prevailed in rallying the peoples of the Caucasus Mountains in a guerilla war to defend our homeland. Today the Council still oversees home defence in the face of rising tensions with our neighbors, despite some questioning the seemingly unlimited powers of the Council."
 ARM_armenian_national_army:0 "Armenian National Army"
 ARM_armenian_national_army_desc:0 "The Armenian National Army was formed very quickly in the aftermath of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to defend Armenia from advancing Ottoman troops, and later Georgians and Azerbaijanis. Despite being well motivated and experienced, we lack trained officers and rely on militas to fill the gaps in our lines."
 ARM_our_motherland_one_nation_one_homeland:0 "Our Motherland, One Nation One Homeland"
 ARM_our_motherland_one_nation_one_homeland_desc:0 "Against all odds, and invasion by nearly all of our neighbors, Armenia has prevailed in establishing her own nation-state. After losing so many of our families and much of our territory, Armenians will not give up what they have tenaciously fought for."
 ARM_alexandropol_artillery_workshop:0 "Gyumri Artillery Workshop"
 ARM_alexandropol_artillery_workshop_desc:0 "The Alexandropol (now Gyumri) Artillery Workshop & Fortress was established in 1834 to maintain the Tsar's campaigns in the Caucasus. After the Russians left the region following the revolution, the fortress was crucial in providing Armenia with artillery during the initial years of struggle against our neighbors. The functions have since been continued by Armenia, and serves as a possible base to improve upon our artillery."
 GEO_georgian_army:0 "Georgian Army"
 GEO_georgian_army_desc:0 "Despite possessing almost 200,000 veterans from WW1, including skilled generals and officers, the government has failed to build up an effective military force. Most of our strength is on furlough during peacetime, and thus mobilization is slow and messy."
 GEO_peoples_gard:0 "People's Guard"
 GEO_peoples_gard_desc:0 "The People's Guard is a highly politicized military structure placed directly under the control of parliament rather than the Ministry of War. As the highly privileged military force of the country, it has the power to field strong militias to defend the country."
 GEO_azr_geo_agreements:0 "Azerbaijani-Georgian Agreements"
 GEO_azr_geo_agreements_desc:0 "In spite of the territorial dispute over the Zaqatala district, Georgia and Azerbaijan maintained peaceful relations after their independence and quickly signed the Georgian-Azerbaijani agreements, still in effect today. Georgia recieves fuel and grain from Azerbaijan, while they recieve coal, manganese, and weapons. Further agreements cover trade, railway cooperation, finance, barter of food and grain, and so on. We may also potentially choose to renew the since-expired mutual defense clause."

 AZR_booming_oil_economy_desc:0 "Thanks to the export of oil, of which is in plentiful supply in Baku, the Azerbaijani economy is in quite a boom. This surplus of government funds is amazing for the economy, but there is little incentive for investors to join other sectors of the economy."
