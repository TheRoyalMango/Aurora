In this high rank and in this responsible post he remained until September 13, 1918, when, after long and difficult negotiations, he recognized the Provisional Siberian Government, to which he transferred his sovereign powers, resigning as the Temporary Ruler and remaining High Commissioner for the Far East.

 rus.1.d:0 "Regrettably, we have observed a concerning level of factionalism and infighting within the movement. This internal discord threatens to undermine the effectiveness and unity of the anti-Bolshevik forces. \n Multiple factions within the White Movement have emerged, each advocating for different strategies, priorities, and leadership. The lack of a cohesive and unified front hampers the movement's ability to coordinate military operations, consolidate resources, and present a formidable challenge to the Bolshevik forces. \n Prominent factions contributing to the internal discord include the National Union of War Participants(RNSUV), the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), and republican factions such as the Kadets. However, there are still other minor factions and even factions within these factions.\n The resulting fragmentation poses significant challenges to our shared objective of restoring stability and order in Russia."

 rus.2.d:0 "After South Russia was transformed into the Crimean Mandate in the 1920s, General Kornilov was still recovering in a Paris hospital from grevious wounds suffered in the siege of Yekaterinodar in 1918. As part of the agreement with the Soviets to allow the Crimean Mandate to exist, certain prominent nationalist figures not already in Crimea were to be barred entry, including Kornilov. \n Despite this, last night Kornilov and a few compatriots snuck onto a food shipment to Crimea and only revealed themselves at the port in Sevastopol. When arrested by the authorities Kornilov, now 66, meekly claimed he wished to retire in Yalta amongst his own beloved people. Amidst large pressure from the Russian populace, the Mandate authorities released Kornilov with no charges and no intent of deportation. Moscow released a strongly-worded objection to these events, but the weak political situation in the Soviet government likely contributed to the descision to allow Kornilov to stay. \n His release from jail was met with a welcome party of thousands and a 21-gun salute by the Bogatyr-Class Cruiser which bares his name - The General Kornilov. Despite the Mandate Council's best efforts to downplay his return, many newspapers are already lauding the general's return as a sign that the White Movement is not yet lost."

 rus.4.d:0 "General Lavr Kornilov, a renowned hero of the Civil War and a symbol of Volunteerism, has successfully executed a Coup d'Etat!\n \nAccompanied by the Kornilov Shock Division, he marched into the Sevastopol Mandate Building and emerged two hours later with a declaration on the dissolution of the Crimean Mandate and the transfer of governing power to a committee consisting of ex-Russian Army officers. In a speech to an elated crowd, General Kornilov announced the revival of the South Russian Government and the White Movement as a whole. The committee of ex-Russian Army officers will convene immediately to determine the composition of a new government. \n \nNot long after, invited prominent politicans and generals of suprisingly diverse views were seen arriving at the Mandate Building, including Boris Savinkov, Alexander Krivoshein, Alexander Guchkov, Pyotr Wrangel, and even Metropolitan Anthony. \n \n Noticably, no members of extreme far-right parties were invited. If rumors are to be believed, Boris Savinkov, a previous associate of Kornilov and fierce anti-totalitarian, met with him personally and convinced him to not invite any extreme right-wing movements. Alternate rumors propose it was Wrangel; swayed by his anti-fascist associate Alexander Guchkov, used his influence as former Pravitel to convince Kornilov that extreme right-wing movements only pose a danger to popular support for any new government."

 rus.53.t:0 "Choosing Our Leadership"
 rus.53.d:0 "\n\n Pytor Wrangel, chairman of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), was the first to receive an invitation to join the committee. The ROVS positions itself as the successor of the Imperial Army and the White armies, upholding their traditions. While declaring to be apolitical, the Union's membership tends to lean center-right with monarchist views. However, the ROVS has pledged to leave the political fate of Russia to a constituent assembly formed after unification, and would rule as a military dictatorship meanwhile. It should be noted that during the civil war, the ROVS's predecessor (Wrangel's army & government) were enacting some fairly liberal reforms. \n \n Guchkov and Krivoshein have put forward a democratic coalition government under the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadet). The Kadets were a liberal party in Russia that advocated for constitutional reform, civil liberties, and a parliamentary system. They played a significant role during the early stages of the Revolution and the Provisional Government period. Krivoshein himself was a popular statesman of the Russian Empire, involved in the Stolypin reforms and was an exceptional statesman in Wrangel's 1920 government. Additionally, Guchkov was a supporter of Kornilov during his 1917 coup. Thus many liberal papers reporting on the election urge Wrangel and Kornilov to back the democratic coalition. Savinkov has even expressed interest in joining the Kadets. \n \n Lastly, Anton Turkul, of the Russian National Union of War Participants (RNSUV) and former commander of the Kornilov Shock Division, has called for his military union to be elected, despite not even being invited inside. The RNSUV is an is an extreme-right military-political organization, who broke off from the ROVS after being expelled for having strong political opinions. They are amongst few White Russians to be openly pro-German and have declared bluntly "Our ideal is a fascist monarchy." There is a fear that RNSUV officers in the Kornilov Shock Division, which is guarding the committee, may force their own outcome after being denied a voice. Turkul or other right-wing figures are the potential leaders." #Boris Savinkov has joined the Kadet coalition, but advocates for a temporary military Pravitel (leader) in lieu of a civilian president Krivoshein.

With the Great Depression in full swing, and lack of support from the American people, the government of the United States of America have announced they will no longer be enforcing Alaska neutrality, and instead of focusing on issues at home.

 rus.65.t:0 "Publishing of Drozdovtsy on Fire"
 rus.65.d:0 "Drozdovtsy on Fire - the memoirs of Anton Turkul, the commander of Drozdovtsy units. In the book, he writes an artistic recreation of the history of the Civil War. The publication chronologically outlines the events from the Drozdovites' Campaign Yassy-Don (March 1918) to the creation of the Crimean Mandate (Late 1920), i.e., almost the entire course of the Civil War in Russia in the south. There are flashbacks to the events of the Great War when describing individuals. The author himself described his work not as memoirs or historical work, but as “the combat truth about what Russian white soldiers were like in the fire, what they should be and will inevitably be.”\n The book is sure to become an instant best seller in Crimea, and will be perfect alongside Wrangel's memoirs "Always with Honor" published a few years earlier for those researching the Civil War."
 rus.65.a:0 "Interesting"
