	#Union of Cities of the Republic of Georgia, the Union of Co-operatives of Tbilisi, and the Central Food Council of the Georgian Democratic Republic, signed contracts for the barter of food and grain with administrative units in Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Supply in Georgia for different commodities. Georgia was most interested in oil as well as food products from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan meanwhile was importing coal and manganese from Georgia
